    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe for Carnitas tacos is pretty simple and delicious. It is adapted from 
        J Kenji Lopez's recipe found on <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/no-waste-tacos-de-carnitas-with-salsa-verde-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Serious eats</a>
         It does take some time to cook so it makes for a better weekend meal then weekday, but active time is
        only about 20 to 30 mins. It also takes few ingredients, most of which are pantry 
        staples. It is a favorite of my families and hopefully will be yours too!
