    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Snickerdoodles are my favorite cookies. They are not super challenging
        to make and are also delicious. Use a scale to measure out the ingredients. This recipe is adapted from Stella Parks' recipe
        on <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/new-fashioned-snickerdoodle-cookie-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noopenner noreferrer">Serious Eats</a>
