# odin-recipes
The project is to create a basic recipe website with an index page that links to 3 seperate recipe pages. The recipe pages must include a picture of the recipe, an unordered list of the ingrediants, and an ordered list of the steps to make the recipe. 

Completing this project will demonstrate my knowledge of html syntax inlcuding how to link to different pages, how to include images, how to make both ordered and unordered lists, and how to properly format them using just html.
